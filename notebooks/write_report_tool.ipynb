    "1. *Get the full chat history in order to see al relevant analysis performed*\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **challenges:** \n",
    "\n",
    "    - If chat gets summarized, previous analysis are blurred out. We need detailed history, but at the same time we cannot input more than a certain number of tokens to the model that produces the analysis. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    **solutions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - we need to keep the full chat state somewhere when we summarize. Maybe store it in state. Could be a long `analysis` str, or could be a virtual file in the virtual file system. Then the `write_report()` tool could split the full history in sections in order not to exceed context length.     \n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Collect all sources used - meaning, the list of all datasets analized*\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **challenges:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We have to keep track of all used datasets.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **solutions:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Just add a state var `sources`; it gets filled every time we **select** a dataset with the `select_dataset` tool. The model that writes the report can then cite the source throughout the report, understanding when it was used from chat history.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Produce an extensive report (.md format probably)*\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "> **? Should the report include python code ?**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> It could be useful to include in the report - or somewhere else - all python code written during the analysis. \n",
    "> If could be a section/appendyx in the report, or a separate file that the user can ask to be given. \n",
    "> or simply another state str that gets filled up anytime the code exec runs - then we manually combine it into an appendyx in the report. i Just don't want it to be like 3000 lines at the end of the report. maybe they should be separate files. \n",

The objective is to compare their main characteristics and highlight any notable findings based on the available data.\\n\\n## Overview of Datasets\\n\\nBoth dataset1 and dataset2 were examined to understand their structure and content. Descriptive statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation were calculated for each dataset. The distributions of the data were also reviewed to identify any patterns or anomalies.\\n\\n## Key Findings\\n\\n- **Descriptive Statistics:**\\n  - Dataset1 and dataset2 were summarized using standard statistical measures. Central tendencies and variability were compared to identify similarities and differences.\\n  - Any significant outliers or unusual data points were noted in both datasets.\\n\\n- **Comparative Insights:**\\n  - The analysis highlighted areas where the datasets were similar, such as comparable ranges or distribution shapes.\\n  - Differences in key metrics, such as mean values or spread, were identified and discussed.\\n\\n## Limitations\\n\\n- The analysis was limited to basic statistical comparison due to the scope of the test.\\n- No external validation or advanced modeling was performed.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe comparative analysis of dataset1 and dataset2 provided an overview of their main characteristics, highlighting both similarities and differences.
